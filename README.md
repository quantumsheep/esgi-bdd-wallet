# ESGI Behavior-Driven Development's Project - Wallet
Given a "Wallet" containing Stocks, build a function that computes the value of the "Wallet" into a currency. The Stocks have a quantity and a type. The type can be for example TLSA, GME, EUR, USD, BTC, etc...

To value the portfolio in a specific currency you can use an external API to provide rate exchanges.
